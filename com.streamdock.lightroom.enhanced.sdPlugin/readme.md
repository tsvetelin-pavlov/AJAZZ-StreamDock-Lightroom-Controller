## Precautions

Windows: The software version needs to be `3.10.188.226` or above. Starting from `3.10.188.226`, the software has a built-in node module, and the built-in node version is `20.8.1`. Set Version in manifest to `20`. Other versions are not built-in yet. 

Mac: `3.10.189.0313` is not built-in yet, and you need to wait for the next version
